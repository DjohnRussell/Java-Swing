Some Swing projects

if you read this, well i guess that means you are nosie:P 

i'll give you some kind works: 

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

;P

BestillingApp (Auyomat)

This Java Swing project represents a significant milestone in my second year of computer engineering. During this year, we were tasked with creating an autonomous robot designed to fulfill a crucial role during challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in vulnerable locations like hospitals. The core idea behind this project was to blend advanced technology with practical applications that could make a meaningful difference.

The central concept was to develop an application, which we affectionately named "BestillingApp" (Ordering App), that would serve as a vital bridge between our autonomous robot and the needs of people in places like hospitals. Here's a more detailed overview:

Robot's Mission:
Our autonomous robot was engineered to replace human interactions in settings that required minimal contact during extraordinary circumstances, such as a global pandemic. Specifically, our robot was designed to provide meal delivery services in hospital rooms during lunch, dinner, and evenings.

Technology Stack:
The heart of our robot featured a Raspberry Pi, a versatile mini-computer, running on a Linux-based Ubuntu operating system. Additionally, the Raspberry Pi served as an Apache web server to facilitate communication and order management. A user-friendly interface was created through a Java Swing-based application, known as BestillingApp.

Ordering Platform:
BestillingApp was conceived as an ordering platform that allowed users to place orders conveniently and efficiently. Users could enter their room or table number via the app, specifying their requirements. Once submitted, a text file containing the order details was sent to the chosen location.

Seamless Code Update:
To ensure the robot's smooth operation and the application's continued improvement, we implemented a feature for remote code updates. Within the same directory as the ordering app, we included a Bash script that leveraged SSH Secure Remote Protocol (SRP) to update the robot's code. This script could update all devices simultaneously or target a specific device, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance.

In essence, our project not only showcased technical innovation but also addressed real-world challenges by introducing automation and reducing human contact in critical environments. BestillingApp played a pivotal role in this initiative, making it possible for users to interact with the robot effortlessly, while the Raspberry Pi-powered robot executed its tasks with precision and efficiency.
